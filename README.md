# Ball simulations (in progress)
The point of creating this repository is to learn basic physics and probably (in the future) creating basic physics engine.

## How it works
There are 2 different files here. One is ball_simulation_class.py, and shows ball simulations with gravity included. The second file ball_simulation.py is showing basic context for Verlet integration (it will be possibly used for my different project for billard game).
